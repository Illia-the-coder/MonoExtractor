## Usage

1. Get your Monobank API token. Follow the instructions provided in the [Getting the Monobank API Token](#getting-the-monobank-api-token) section.
2. Replace the `token` variable in the main script with your Monobank API token.
3. Replace the `account_id` variable in the main script with your account id.
4. Run the script. The script will generate a CSV file `monobank.csv` with your account statements.

## Getting the Monobank API Token

Follow these steps to obtain your Monobank API Token:

1. Navigate to the Monobank API documentation: [https://api.monobank.ua/](https://api.monobank.ua/)
2. Follow their specific instructions for obtaining an API token.

Note: As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, the Monobank API was primarily documented in Ukrainian. You may need to use a translation tool or seek additional help if you don't understand Ukrainian. The process of obtaining an API token may require you to log into your Monobank account, and might be facilitated through the Monobank mobile application.

Please note: Treat your API token like a password. Do not share it, store it publicly, or commit it to version control. The API token provides access to your account data.

Please always refer to the official documentation for the most accurate and up-to-date information.

If there are other API keys involved in your project, you should provide similar instructions pointing to the official documentation of those services as well.
